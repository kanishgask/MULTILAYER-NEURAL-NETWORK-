**Breast Cancer Classification with Neural Network**
This project implements a simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

**Features**
Loads and normalizes the dataset

Uses tanh activation in the hidden layer and sigmoid in the output

Computes binary cross-entropy loss

Trains with backpropagation and gradient descent

Evaluates accuracy on test data

Plots training loss curve over epochs

**Requirements**
Python 3.x

numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib

Install dependencies with:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
**Usage**
Run the Python script to train the network and visualize the loss curve. The model typically achieves around 96% test accuracy.

** Output**
yaml
Copy
Edit
Epoch 0: Loss = 0.6931, Accuracy = 0.62
Epoch 100: Loss = 0.45, Accuracy = 0.86
Epoch 200: Loss = 0.35, Accuracy = 0.90
...
Epoch 1000: Loss = 0.14, Accuracy = 0.97

Test Accuracy: 0.96
